# StarLink Tracker
:dizzy: <strong> Overview </strong>: A React JS based Starlink Trajectory Visualization Web Application
<p>I am always fascinated by the universe, and love to watch the sky for hours looking for stars. This project aims at tracking the Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX based on the observer's geo location information including longitude, latitude, altitude, and radius. The observer can provide the info in the form and submit to see a list of nearby satellites. Then he/she can select one or multiple satellites to track on the world map to the righthand side of the dashboard. Additionally, the observer needs to fill the duration(0-59 mins) to see the path of the selected nearby Starlink satellites during the requested time duration (converted from minutes to seconds). During the tracking, the observer can abort the process at any time and revise the tracking request.</p>
